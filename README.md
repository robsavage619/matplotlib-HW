1.) Capomulin and Ramicane are Effective
The biggest takeaway from the data, especially as we started zeroing in on specific treatments is that
Capomulin and Ramicane tend to have the greatest impact on reducing tumor size. From looking at the median
size on charts spread out across the entire array of treatments, there are significant jumps for those two
drugs.

2.) Capomulin and Ramicane Extend Life
Using the aforementioned drugs above, Capomulin and Ramicane also had the ability to administer more 
overall treatments. The drugs seem to have kept their mice alive longer to be able to give additional 
treatments. While this does skew the overall median of tumor size in the data (since they were able to 
give more treatments), it does prove to be effective. 

3.) Capomulin and Ramicane Have Reliability
Looking at the box plots for the most effective treatments (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin)
there is a large variability for Infubinol and Ceftamin. Aside from their obvious large tumor volume 
numbers, much of their data is spread out with a large variety of volume figures. It's hard to really 
decide from their boxplot how reliable their numbers are. Capomulin and Ramicane have much narrower boxes
giving confidence that the results are replicable.
